Kepler's First Law🌌
Kepler's First Law states that planets orbit the Sun in an elliptical path rather than a perfect circle. 🌍 The Sun is located at one of the two foci of the ellipse, not at the center. This means that as a planet moves along its orbit, its distance from the Sun changes.

Perihelion: The point where the planet is closest to the Sun 🌞.
Aphelion: The point where the planet is farthest from the Sun 🌠.
This elliptical orbit explains the varying speeds at which planets travel during their orbits: they move faster when closer to the Sun and slower when farther away.

What Was Made Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
HTML: The structure of the page was built using HTML to display the summary of Kepler’s First Law and relevant explanations. It included sections like the title, text, and labels for the key concepts of the law.

CSS: The styling was done with CSS to make the page visually appealing. I used CSS to style headings, paragraphs, and added fun emojis like 🌍 and 🌞. Additionally, CSS animations or transitions might be used to animate the elliptical orbit or any visuals representing the planets' movement.

JavaScript: JavaScript was added for interactive elements, such as animating the orbit of a planet in an elliptical shape or creating a visual of the Sun at the focus of the ellipse. JavaScript could also handle things like user input or dynamically updating information.
